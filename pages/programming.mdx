# Programming and Assembling Your ATtiny85 Game

This page will guide you through the process of uploading the game code to your ATtiny85 and assembling the final project.

<Steps>

### Prepare the Game Code

1. Download the ATtiny Games ZIP file: [ATtiny_Games.zip](/files/ATtiny_Games.zip)
2. Extract the ZIP file on your computer
3. Open the Arduino IDE
4. Navigate to File > Open and select the .ino file of the game you want to play from the extracted folder

### Upload the Game to ATtiny85

1. Ensure your ATtiny85 is still connected to the Arduino as described in the setup page
2. In Arduino IDE, click on Sketch > Upload Using Programmer

### Connect ATtiny85 to OLED Display

Use the following connection table:

| Display Pin | ATtiny85 Pin | ATtiny85 Function |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| SDA         | 2            | SDA (PB3)         |
| SCL         | 3            | SCL (PB4)         |
| GND         | 4            | GND               |
| Vcc         | 8            | Vcc               |

### Connect Buttons

<Callout type="warning">
  For the specific wiring configuration for the buttons, please consult a Maker Society volunteer. They will provide you with the correct setup for your particular game.
</Callout>

### Power Up and Play!

1. Power up your ATtiny85 setup
2. The game should start on the OLED display
3. Use the buttons to control the game

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Double-check all connections
- Ensure proper power and ground connections
- Verify correct board, processor, clock, and programmer settings in Arduino IDE
- If ATtiny85 isn't recognized, try pressing the reset button on Arduino just before uploading
- For display issues, check I2C connections and ensure necessary libraries are installed

<Callout type="success">
  Congratulations! You've now set up, programmed, and assembled your very own ATtiny85-powered game. Enjoy playing and feel free to experiment with modifying the game code or trying out different games from the repository.
