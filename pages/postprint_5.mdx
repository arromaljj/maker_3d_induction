# Post-Processing and Finishing Your Keychain

Congratulations on completing your 3D print! Now it's time to remove your keychain from the printer, clean it up, and add the final touches. This process is crucial for achieving a polished, professional-looking result.

## Removing the Print from the Bed

<Steps>
1. Wait for the print bed to cool down completely. This helps prevent warping and makes removal easier.

2. Gently flex the print bed. The Bambu P1P typically uses a flexible, magnetic bed that can be removed and bent slightly to help pop off the print.

3. If the print doesn't come off easily, use a thin spatula or the provided scraper tool. Carefully work it under the edge of the print.

4. Slowly work your way around the print, gently prying it up until it comes free from the bed.
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Be patient and gentle during removal. Rushing or using too much force can damage your print or the print bed.

## Cleaning Up Support Structures

If your print required support structures, you'll need to remove these carefully:

<Steps>
1. Identify the support structures. These are typically easily distinguishable from the main part of your print.

2. Use pliers or flush cutters to remove larger support structures. Grip the support near the base and twist gently to break it free.

3. For smaller or more delicate supports, use a hobby knife or small file. Be careful not to scratch or gouge the main part of your print.

4. Sand any remaining support marks or rough areas. Start with a coarser grit sandpaper (around 220 grit) and progressively move to finer grits for a smooth finish.
</Steps>

  If your keychain has intricate details, consider using needle files or sanding sticks for more precise clean-up.

## Adding a Keyring

Now that your keychain is clean and smooth, it's time to add the keyring:

<Steps>
1. Locate the hole in your keychain design intended for the keyring. If there isn't one, you may need to carefully drill a small hole.

2. Open the jump ring (the small metal ring that will connect your keychain to the larger keyring) using pliers. Twist to open, don't pull apart.

3. Thread the jump ring through the hole in your keychain.

4. Add your chosen keyring to the jump ring.

5. Use pliers to close the jump ring, ensuring the ends meet precisely for a secure closure.
</Steps>

  If you're having trouble with the jump ring, you can alternatively use a small length of thin wire or fishing line to attach the keyring.

## Optional Finishing Touches

To give your keychain an even more professional look, consider these optional finishing steps:

1. **Painting**: Use acrylic paints to add color to your keychain. Apply a primer first for better paint adhesion.

2. **Clear coating**: Apply a clear acrylic spray to protect your keychain and give it a glossy finish.

3. **Polishing**: For a high-shine finish, use progressively finer grits of sandpaper, finishing with a polishing compound.

<Callout type="tip">
  Always test paints or clear coats on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure compatibility with your filament type.

## Caring for Your Keychain

To keep your 3D printed keychain looking great:

- Avoid exposing it to extreme heat, which can cause warping.
- Clean it occasionally with mild soap and water, drying thoroughly.
- If the keychain becomes scratched, you can lightly sand and refinish it.
