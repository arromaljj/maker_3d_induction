# ATtiny85 Game Setup

This page will guide you through the process of setting up your development environment and preparing the hardware for ATtiny85 game programming.

<Steps>

### Install Arduino IDE

1. Download and install the latest version of the Arduino IDE from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### Prepare Arduino as ISP

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Go to File > Examples > ArduinoISP > ArduinoISP
3. Connect your Arduino UNO to your computer
4. Upload the ArduinoISP sketch to your Arduino UNO

### Set up ATtiny85 Board Support

1. In Arduino IDE, go to File > Preferences
2. In the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field, add:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package_damellis_attiny_index.json
   ```
3. Click "OK" to save
4. Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager
5. Search for "attiny" and install the "ATtiny" package by David A. Mellis

### Configure Board Settings

1. Go to Tools > Board and select "ATtiny25/45/85"
2. Set Tools > Processor to "ATtiny85"
3. Set Tools > Clock to "Internal 8 MHz"

### Connect ATtiny85 to Arduino

Use the following connection table:

| Arduino Pin | ATtiny85 Pin | ATtiny85 Function |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 5V          | 8            | Vcc               |
| GND         | 4            | GND               |
| 10          | 1            | RESET             |
| 11          | 5            | MOSI (PB0)        |
| 12          | 6            | MISO (PB1)        |
| 13          | 7            | SCK (PB2)         |

<Callout type="info">
  Additional Connection: Connect a 10 ÂµF capacitor between ATtiny85's RESET (Pin 1) and GND, with the positive lead on RESET.
</Callout>

### Burn the Bootloader

1. In Arduino IDE, set Tools > Programmer to "Arduino as ISP"
2. Click on Tools > Burn Bootloader

</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
  Now that your setup is complete, you're ready to move on to programming the ATtiny85 with your game code!
