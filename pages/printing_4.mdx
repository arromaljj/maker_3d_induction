# 3D Printing Your Keychain

Now that your model is prepared and sliced, it's time to bring your design to life! In this section, we'll cover two methods of printing your keychain: using 3D Printer OS and printing directly from an SD card.

## 4.1 Using 3D Printer OS

3D Printer OS is a cloud-based platform that allows you to manage and control your 3D printer remotely. Here's how to use it with your Bambu P1P printer:

### Logging into 3D Printer OS

<Steps>
1. Open your web browser and go to the [3D Printer OS website](https://www.3dprinteros.com/)
2. Click on "Login" in the top right corner
3. Enter your credentials (username and password)
4. Once logged in, you should see your dashboard
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  If you don't have a 3D Printer OS account, you'll need to create one. Click on "Sign Up" and follow the prompts to set up your account.
</Callout>

### Uploading your file

<Steps>
1. In your 3D Printer OS dashboard, click on "Upload Files"
2. Select the .3mf file you exported from Bambu Studio
3. Wait for the file to upload completely
</Steps>

### Initiating the print

<Steps>
1. Once your file is uploaded, find it in your file list
2. Click on the file name to select it
3. Choose your Bambu P1P printer from the printer list
4. Click on "Print" to start the printing process
5. Confirm any final settings or prompts that appear
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Before starting the print, ensure that the printer is turned on, connected to the network, and has the correct filament loaded.
</Callout>

## 4.2 Printing from SD Card

If you prefer a more direct approach or if 3D Printer OS is unavailable, you can print directly from an SD card using the Bambu P1P's interface.

### Saving the file to an SD card

<Steps>
1. Insert an SD card into your computer
2. Locate the .3mf file you exported from Bambu Studio
3. Copy the file to the SD card
4. Safely eject the SD card from your computer
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  Make sure your SD card is formatted to FAT32 and has enough free space for your file.
</Callout>

### Inserting the SD card into the Bambu P1P printer

<Steps>
1. Locate the SD card slot on your Bambu P1P printer
2. Gently insert the SD card into the slot, ensuring it's oriented correctly
3. Push the card in until it clicks into place
</Steps>

### Starting the print from the printer interface

<Steps>
1. On the Bambu P1P's touch screen, navigate to the "Print" menu
2. Select "Print from SD"
3. Locate your file in the list and tap on it
4. Review the print settings displayed on the screen
5. If everything looks correct, tap "Start" to begin the printing process
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Before starting the print, ensure that the printer bed is clean and properly leveled, and that you have enough filament loaded for the entire print job.
</Callout>

## Monitoring Your Print

Regardless of which method you use to start your print, it's important to monitor the process, especially at the beginning:

1. Watch the first layer being printed to ensure proper adhesion to the print bed
2. Check periodically to make sure the print is progressing as expected
3. Be prepared to pause or cancel the print if you notice any issues (e.g., filament tangling, part detaching from the bed)

<Callout type="info">
  The Bambu P1P has a built-in camera that you can use to monitor your print remotely through the Bambu Handy app or 3D Printer OS.
</Callout>

Congratulations! Your keychain is now being printed. In the next section, we'll cover how to remove the print from the bed and perform any necessary post-processing.
