# Introduction to ATtiny85 Game Programming

Welcome to the ATtiny85 Game Programming tutorial! This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and programming an ATtiny85 microcontroller to play games using an Arduino board as an In-System Programmer (ISP).

## What You'll Learn

- How to set up the Arduino IDE for ATtiny85 development
- Programming an Arduino as an ISP (In-System Programmer)
- Uploading game code to an ATtiny85
- Connecting an OLED display and buttons to play the game

## Materials Needed

Before we begin, make sure you have the following components:

- Arduino UNO board
- ATtiny85 microcontroller
- SSD1306 OLED display (128x64 pixels)
- 2 push buttons
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- 10 ÂµF capacitor
- USB cable for Arduino

## Project Overview

This project involves three main stages:

1. **Setup**: Preparing your development environment and hardware.
2. **Programming**: Uploading the game code to the ATtiny85.
3. **Assembly**: Connecting the programmed ATtiny85 to the display and buttons.

In the following pages, we'll go through each of these stages in detail. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional game running on your ATtiny85!
