# Welcome to the 3D Printer Induction Course

Are you ready to dive into the exciting world of 3D printing? This course will guide you through the process of designing and printing your very own personalized keychain. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of the 3D printing workflow and a cool, custom-made item to show for it!

## Course Objective

**Learn the basics of 3D printing by designing and printing a personalized keychain.**

This hands-on course will take you through every step of the 3D printing process, from initial design to final product. You'll gain practical experience with industry-standard tools and techniques, all while creating a unique, personalized item.

## Course Overview

In this course, you'll experience the entire 3D printing process from start to finish. We'll begin with digital design, move through 3D modeling, and end with a physical object hot off the printer. Here's what you can expect:

1. Design your keychain using simple, free online tools
2. Convert your 2D design into a 3D model
3. Prepare your model for printing
4. Use a Bambu P1P 3D printer to bring your design to life
