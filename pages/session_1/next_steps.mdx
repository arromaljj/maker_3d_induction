# Next Steps: PCB Manufacturing and Assembly

Congratulations on completing your Tiny Arcade Game PCB design and preparing the manufacturing files! Now it's time to turn your digital design into a physical board. Let's walk through the next steps in bringing your project to life.

## Choosing a PCB Manufacturer

Selecting the right PCB manufacturer is crucial for ensuring the quality and cost-effectiveness of your project.

### Factors to Consider

1. **Price**: Compare quotes from different manufacturers.
2. **Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ)**: Some manufacturers have a minimum order, often 5 or 10 PCBs.
3. **Turnaround Time**: How quickly can they produce and ship your boards?
4. **Quality**: Look for reviews or ask for samples if possible.
5. **Capabilities**: Ensure they can handle your design specifications (board size, number of layers, etc.).
6. **Additional Services**: Some offer assembly services if you're interested in that option.

### Popular PCB Manufacturers

Here are some well-known PCB manufacturers to consider:

- [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)
- [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/)
- [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/)
- [Seeed Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html)

## Ordering Your PCBs

Once you've chosen a manufacturer, it's time to place your order.

<Steps>
### Prepare Your Files
1. Ensure your Gerber and drill files are zipped in a single archive.
2. Double-check that all necessary files are included.

### Upload Your Design
1. Go to your chosen manufacturer's website.
2. Look for an option to upload Gerber files or start a new order.
3. Upload your zipped file containing the Gerber and drill files.

### Specify Board Parameters
1. Enter the required information:
   - Board dimensions
   - Number of layers (2 for our project)
   - PCB thickness (typically 1.6mm for hobby projects)
   - Copper weight (1 oz is standard)
   - Surface finish (HASL lead-free is a good default choice)
   - Silkscreen color
   - Solder mask color

### Review and Order
1. Carefully review all specifications.
2. Check the price and lead time.
3. Select quantity (remember the MOQ).
4. Place your order and make payment.

## Preparing for Assembly

While waiting for your PCBs to arrive, you can start preparing for the assembly process.

### Ordering Components

1. **Create a Bill of Materials (BOM)**: List all components needed for your Tiny Arcade Game.
2. **Source Components**: Order from reputable suppliers like Digikey, Mouser, or LCSC.
3. **Consider Extras**: Order a few extra of each component in case of loss or damage during assembly.

### Gathering Tools

Ensure you have the necessary tools for assembly:

- Soldering iron and solder
- Flux pen
- Tweezers
- Magnifying glass or loupe
- Multimeter
- Solder wick or desoldering pump (for corrections)

### Reviewing Assembly Process

1. **Study the PCB Layout**: Familiarize yourself with component placements.
2. **Plan Your Assembly Order**: Generally, start with smaller components and work your way up to larger ones.
3. **Review Soldering Techniques**: Refresh your knowledge on through-hole and SMD soldering if needed.
