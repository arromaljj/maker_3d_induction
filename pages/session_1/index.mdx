## What You'll Create

Imagine holding a fully functional arcade game that you can power with any USB port. That's exactly what you'll achieve by the end of this series! Your Tiny Arcade Game will feature:

- A compact, custom-designed PCB
- An ATtiny85 microcontroller as the brain
- A vibrant OLED display for crisp graphics
- Intuitive button controls for gameplay
- A piezo buzzer for those classic game sounds
- Powered by USB for easy connectivity and play anywhere

But more than just a cool gadget, this project is your gateway to the world of PCB design, electronics assembly, embedded programming, and USB power management!

## Our 3-Session Journey

### Session 1: PCB Design Magic (September 25th)
- Dive into the fundamentals of PCB design
- Unravel the circuit theory behind our game, including USB power management
- Get hands-on with KiCad, a professional PCB design tool
- Design the heart of your arcade game - the custom PCB with USB power
- Learn about Design Rule Checking to ensure manufacturability

**Outcome:** By the end of this session, you'll have designed a professional-quality PCB ready for manufacturing!

### Session 2: From Virtual to Reality (October 2nd)
- Witness your PCB design come to life as physical boards
- Master the art of soldering components, including surface-mount devices
- Assemble your Tiny Arcade Game PCB, including the USB connector
- Learn about component identification and placement
- Troubleshoot common assembly issues and perform initial testing

**Outcome:** You'll hold in your hands a fully assembled, USB-powered Tiny Arcade Game PCB!

### Session 3: Bringing Your Game to Life (October 9th)
- Set up the Arduino IDE for ATtiny85 programming
- Write your first game code - let's start with a simple "Pong" clone
- Learn about graphics programming on a small OLED display
- Implement game logic, controls, and sound effects
- Explore power-efficient coding techniques
- Test and debug your game on the physical hardware

**Outcome:** Play your very own, self-made, USB-powered Tiny Arcade Game!
