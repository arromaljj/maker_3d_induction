# Introduction to Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)

Welcome to the first session of our Tiny Arcade Game tutorial series! Today, we'll be diving into the world of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and laying the foundation for our exciting project.

## What is a PCB?

A Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is a board that connects electronic components using conductive tracks, pads, and other features. It serves as the backbone of almost every electronic device you use daily.

  Fun Fact: The concept of PCBs dates back to the early 20th century, but they became widely used in the 1950s with the advent of transistors.

### Key Components of a PCB

<Steps>
### Substrate
The base material, usually made of fiberglass, that provides structural support.

### Copper Layers
Thin sheets of copper foil laminated onto the substrate, which form the conductive paths.

### Solder Mask
A thin layer of polymer applied to the copper traces to prevent short circuits and oxidation.

### Silkscreen
Printed text and symbols that provide information about component placement and board identification.

## Why are PCBs Needed in Electronics?

PCBs play a crucial role in modern electronics for several reasons:

1. **Compact Design**: PCBs allow for dense component placement, enabling smaller device sizes.
2. **Reliability**: By eliminating the need for individual wires, PCBs reduce the risk of loose connections.
3. **Mass Production**: PCBs can be manufactured in large quantities, reducing costs and improving consistency.
4. **Signal Integrity**: Proper PCB design helps maintain signal quality in high-speed circuits.
5. **Heat Dissipation**: PCBs can be designed with features to help dissipate heat from components.

## Basic PCB Design Concepts

Before we dive into designing our Tiny Arcade Game PCB, let's cover some fundamental design concepts:

- **Schematic**: A diagram representing the electrical connections between components.
- **Layout**: The physical arrangement of components and traces on the PCB.
- **Layers**: PCBs can have multiple layers for complex designs, but we'll focus on a 2-layer board for our project.
- **Trace**: The conductive path that connects components on the PCB.
- **Via**: A small hole that connects traces between different layers of the PCB.

  Remember: Good PCB design is crucial for the proper functioning of your electronic device. Poor design can lead to issues like electromagnetic interference, overheating, or even complete failure.

## Next Steps

Now that we've covered the basics of PCBs, we're ready to start designing our Tiny Arcade Game PCB using KiCad. In the next section, we'll introduce you to KiCad and begin creating our schematic.
