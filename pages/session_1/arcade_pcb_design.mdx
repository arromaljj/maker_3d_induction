# Our Tiny Arcade PCB Design

Now that we've covered the basics of PCB design, let's dive into the specific design for our Tiny Arcade Game. We'll explore the overall design, the rationale behind our choices, and the components we'll be using.

## Design Overview

Our Tiny Arcade Game PCB is designed to be compact, efficient, and easy to assemble. Here are the key features of our design:

- Two-layer PCB for simplicity and cost-effectiveness
- Powered by a CR2032 battery for portability
- Centered around the ATtiny85 microcontroller
- Incorporates an OLED display for the game screen
- Includes three push buttons for user input
- Features a piezo buzzer for sound effects

## Design Rationale

Let's break down the reasoning behind some of our key design decisions:

<Steps>
### Two-Layer PCB
We chose a two-layer design to keep manufacturing costs low while still allowing for efficient routing and a ground plane.

### ATtiny85 Microcontroller
The ATtiny85 is small, low-power, and has just enough capabilities for our arcade game, making it perfect for this project.

### OLED Display
An OLED display provides excellent contrast and low power consumption, ideal for a battery-powered device.

### Three Push Buttons
Three buttons offer enough control options for various games while keeping the design simple.

### CR2032 Battery
This common button cell provides a good balance of size, capacity, and availability.
</Steps>

## Component Selection and Justification

Here's a detailed look at the main components we'll be using and why we chose them:


| Component | Specification | Justification |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ATtiny85 | 8-bit AVR microcontroller, 8KB flash, 512B RAM | Small, low power, sufficient for simple games |
| OLED Display | SSD1306, 128x64 pixels, I2C interface | High contrast, low power, easy to interface |
| Push Buttons | 6x6mm tactile switches | Good tactile feedback, readily available |
| Buzzer | Piezo buzzer, 5V | Simple sound generation, no additional circuitry needed |
| Battery Holder | CR2032 holder, through-hole | Secure connection, easy battery replacement |
| Resistors | 10K Ω x 2, 1K Ω x 1, 6.8K Ω x 1 | Required for proper circuit operation and protection |

<Callout type="warning">
  When selecting components, always check their availability and lead times. For a group project, ensure you can source enough components for all participants.
</Callout>

## PCB Layout Considerations

In designing the PCB layout for our Tiny Arcade Game, we've kept the following considerations in mind:

1. **Compact Design**: We've arranged components to minimize the overall PCB size while ensuring ease of assembly.
2. **Button Placement**: The three push buttons are placed ergonomically for comfortable gameplay.
3. **Display Positioning**: The OLED display is centered on the board for optimal viewing.
4. **Power Management**: We've included a power switch and ensured proper power routing to all components.
5. **Programming Interface**: We've added pads for programming the ATtiny85 using an external programmer.

## Next Steps

Now that we understand the design choices and components for our Tiny Arcade Game PCB, we're ready to start creating the schematic in KiCad. In the next section, we'll walk through the process of translating this design into a workable schematic.
