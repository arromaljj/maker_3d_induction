# Designing the Circuit in KiCad

Now that we're familiar with KiCad, let's dive into designing our Tiny Arcade Game circuit. We'll use KiCad's Schematic Editor (Eeschema) to create a schematic based on the circuit theory we've discussed.

## Setting Up the Project

<Steps>
### Open KiCad
Launch KiCad from your applications menu or desktop shortcut.

### Create a New Project
1. Click on "File" > "New" > "Project"
2. Choose a location for your project and name it "TinyArcadeGame"
3. Click "Create"

### Open Schematic Editor
In the KiCad project manager, double-click on "TinyArcadeGame.kicad_sch" to open the Schematic Editor.
</Steps>

## Adding Components

Now, let's add the components we need for our circuit. We'll use KiCad's built-in libraries to find most of our components.

<Steps>
### Add ATtiny85
1. Click the "Place symbol" button or press 'A' on your keyboard
2. In the Choose Symbol window, type "ATtiny85" in the search bar
3. Select "ATtiny85-20PU" from the list and click OK
4. Place the component on your schematic

### Add OLED Display
1. Press 'A' to add another component
2. Search for "OLED" and select a suitable 128x64 OLED display component
3. If you can't find a suitable component, we'll create a custom one later
4. Place the component on your schematic

### Add Push Buttons
1. Press 'A' to add a component
2. Search for "SW_Push" and select it
3. Place three of these on your schematic

### Add Battery Holder
1. Press 'A' to add a component
2. Search for "Battery_Cell" and select it
3. Place it on your schematic

### Add Piezo Buzzer
1. Press 'A' to add a component
2. Search for "Speaker" or "Buzzer" and select a suitable component
3. Place it on your schematic

### Add Resistors
1. Press 'A' to add a component
2. Search for "R" and select the basic resistor symbol
3. Place four resistors on your schematic

### Add Power and Ground Symbols
1. Use the "Place power port" button or press 'P' to add VCC and GND symbols where needed
</Steps>

  Remember to label your components (e.g., R1, R2, SW1, SW2, etc.) to keep your schematic organized. You can do this by right-clicking on a component and selecting "Properties".
</Callout>

## Connecting Components

Now that we have all our components placed, let's connect them according to our circuit design.

<Steps>
### Connect ATtiny85
1. Connect VCC (pin 8) to the positive terminal of the battery
2. Connect GND (pin 4) to the GND symbol
3. Connect PB0, PB1, and PB2 (pins 5, 6, and 7) to the push buttons
4. Connect PB3 (pin 2) to the piezo buzzer
5. Connect PB4 and PB5 (pins 3 and 1) to the OLED display's SDA and SCL lines

### Connect OLED Display
1. Connect VCC and GND to the appropriate power symbols
2. Connect SDA and SCL to the ATtiny85 as mentioned above

### Connect Push Buttons
1. Connect one side of each button to the appropriate ATtiny85 pin
2. Connect the other side to GND
3. Connect a 10K resistor between each button and VCC (pull-up resistors)

### Connect Piezo Buzzer
1. Connect one terminal to PB3 on the ATtiny85
2. Connect the other terminal to GND

### Connect Battery
1. Connect the positive terminal to VCC
2. Connect the negative terminal to GND
</Steps>

## Adding Custom Components (if necessary)

If you couldn't find a suitable OLED display component, here's how to create a custom one:

<Steps>
### Open Symbol Editor
1. In the Schematic Editor, go to "Tools" > "Symbol Editor"

### Create New Symbol
1. Click "Create new symbol" or press 'N'
2. Name it "OLED_128x64" and save it in your project's library

### Add Pins
1. Use the "Add pins" tool to create pins for VCC, GND, SDA, and SCL
2. Label each pin appropriately

### Save and Use
1. Save your new symbol
2. You can now use this custom symbol in your schematic
</Steps>

## Performing Electrical Rules Check (ERC)

Before we conclude, let's run an Electrical Rules Check to catch any potential issues:

1. Click on the "Perform electrical rules check" button (looks like a bug)
2. Review any warnings or errors and correct them in your schematic

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've now created the schematic for your Tiny Arcade Game in KiCad. In the next section, we'll move on to creating the PCB layout based on this schematic.
