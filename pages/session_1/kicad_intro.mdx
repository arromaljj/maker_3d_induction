# Introduction to KiCad

In this section, we'll introduce KiCad, the software we'll be using to design our Tiny Arcade Game PCB. We'll cover what KiCad is, why we've chosen it for this project, and give you an overview of its interface.

## What is KiCad?

KiCad is a free and open-source software suite for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). It facilitates the design of schematics for electronic circuits and their conversion to PCB designs.

<Callout type="info">
  KiCad was originally developed by Jean-Pierre Charras, but is now maintained by a dedicated team of developers with financial support from CERN and other organizations.

## Why KiCad for Our Project?

We've chosen KiCad for our Tiny Arcade Game project for several reasons:

1. **Free and Open-Source**: KiCad is completely free to use and is continuously improved by a community of developers.
2. **Cross-Platform**: It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring all participants can use it regardless of their operating system.
3. **Comprehensive Tool Suite**: KiCad includes all the tools we need for schematic capture, PCB layout, and 3D visualization.
4. **Large Component Library**: KiCad comes with an extensive library of component symbols and footprints.
5. **Active Community**: There's a wealth of tutorials, forums, and resources available for learning and troubleshooting.
6. **Industry Standard**: KiCad is widely used in both hobby and professional contexts, making it a valuable skill to learn.

## KiCad Interface Overview

KiCad consists of several integrated tools. Let's look at the main ones we'll be using:

<Steps>
### Project Manager
This is the main window of KiCad, from which you can access all other tools.

### Schematic Editor (Eeschema)
This is where we'll draw our circuit schematic.

### PCB Editor (Pcbnew)
Here, we'll layout our components and route our PCB.

### 3D Viewer
This tool allows us to visualize our PCB design in 3D.
</Steps>

Let's take a closer look at each of these:

### Project Manager

The Project Manager is your starting point in KiCad. From here, you can:
- Create new projects
- Open existing projects
- Access the various tools like the Schematic Editor and PCB Editor
- Manage project files

### Schematic Editor (Eeschema)

<Image src="/media/schematic_editor.png" alt="KiCad Schematic Editor" width={600} height={400} />

The Schematic Editor is where we'll create our circuit diagram. Key features include:
- Adding and connecting components
- Editing component properties
- Performing electrical rules check
- Generating netlist for PCB layout

### PCB Editor (Pcbnew)

<Image src="/media/pcb_editor.png" alt="KiCad PCB Editor" width={600} height={400} />

In the PCB Editor, we'll layout our components and route our traces. Here, we can:
- Place components on the board
- Route traces between components
- Add text and graphics to the board
- Perform design rule checks

### 3D Viewer

The 3D Viewer gives us a three-dimensional representation of our PCB. This helps us:
- Visualize the final product
- Check component clearances
- Detect potential mechanical issues

<Callout type="warning">
  While the 3D Viewer is great for visualization, always double-check your design in the PCB Editor. The 3D view is for reference and may not catch all design issues.

## Getting Started with KiCad

To get started with KiCad:

1. Download and install KiCad from the [official website](https://www.kicad.org/download/).
2. Launch KiCad and create a new project (File > New > Project).
3. Familiarize yourself with the interface by exploring the different tools.
4. Download the file: [footprints.zip](/files/footprints.zip)
  

In the next section, we'll dive into creating our schematic using the Schematic Editor.
