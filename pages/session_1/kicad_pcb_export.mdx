# Exporting the PCB Design from KiCad

Now that we've completed our PCB design and run a successful Design Rule Check, it's time to prepare our design for manufacturing. This process involves generating a set of files that PCB manufacturers use to create your board. Let's walk through the steps to export your Tiny Arcade Game PCB design from KiCad.

## Understanding Manufacturing Files

Before we start, let's briefly cover the types of files we'll be generating:

1. **Gerber Files**: These are the industry-standard files for PCB manufacturing. They describe each layer of your PCB.
2. **Drill Files**: These specify the location and size of all holes in your PCB.
3. **Pick and Place Files**: These help with automated component placement if you're getting your board assembled.

## Generating Gerber Files

Let's start by generating the Gerber files:

<Steps>
### Open Plot Dialog
1. In the PCB Editor, go to "File" > "Plot"

### Configure Plot Settings
1. In the "Plot format" section, ensure "Gerber" is selected
2. Set the Output directory to a folder of your choice
3. In the "Layers" section, select the following layers:
   - F.Cu (Front copper)
   - B.Cu (Back copper)
   - F.Paste (Front solder paste)
   - B.Paste (Back solder paste)
   - F.Silkscreen (Front silkscreen)
   - B.Silkscreen (Back silkscreen)
   - F.Mask (Front solder mask)
   - B.Mask (Back solder mask)
   - Edge.Cuts (Board outline)

### Set Plot Options
1. In the "General Options" section:
   - Check "Use Protel filename extensions"
   - Check "Exclude PCB edge layer from other layers"
2. In the "Gerber Options" section:
   - Set "Coordinate format" to 4.6 mm
   - Check "Generate Gerber job file"

### Generate Plot
1. Click "Plot" to generate the Gerber files
2. Don't close the Plot window yet!
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  The Gerber job file (.gbrjob) contains metadata about your PCB and can be useful for some manufacturers.
</Callout>

## Generating Drill Files

Next, let's generate the drill files:

<Steps>
### Open Drill File Generation
1. In the Plot window, click on "Generate Drill Files"

### Configure Drill File Settings
1. Ensure the output directory is the same as for Gerber files
2. In "Drill File Format", select "Excellon"
3. In "Map File Format", select "PostScript"
4. Check "Merge PTH and NPTH holes into one file"

### Generate Drill Files
1. Click "Generate Drill File"
2. Close the drill file window
3. Now you can close the main Plot window
</Steps>

## Generating Pick and Place Files

If you're planning to have your board assembled, you'll need a pick and place file:

<Steps>
### Open Footprint Position File
1. Go to "File" > "Fabrication Outputs" > "Footprint Position (.pos) File"

### Configure Settings
1. Set "Format" to "CSV"
2. Set "Units" to "mm"
3. Choose "Separate files for front and back"

### Generate File
1. Click "Generate Position File"
2. Save the file in the same directory as your Gerber files
</Steps>

## Preparing Files for Manufacturing

Now that we've generated all necessary files, let's prepare them for the manufacturer:

<Steps>
### Compress Files
1. Navigate to your output directory
2. Select all generated files (.gbr, .drl, .pos, .gbrjob)
3. Compress these files into a ZIP archive

### Verify Files
1. Use a Gerber viewer like [gerbv](http://gerbv.geda-project.org/) or online viewers like [Gerblook](https://gerblook.org/) to check your files
2. Ensure all layers are present and correct

### Prepare for Order
1. Have your board dimensions ready (measure in KiCad if you're unsure)
2. Note the number of layers (2 for our project)
3. Decide on any special requirements (board thickness, copper weight, surface finish, etc.)
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Always double-check your compressed file to ensure all necessary files are included before sending to the manufacturer.

## Final Thoughts

Congratulations! You've successfully exported your Tiny Arcade Game PCB design from KiCad and prepared it for manufacturing. These files contain all the information a PCB manufacturer needs to produce your board.

## Next Steps

With your files prepared, you're ready to choose a PCB manufacturer and place an order. In the next section, we'll discuss considerations for choosing a manufacturer and what to expect during the ordering process.

Are you excited to see your PCB design become a reality? Let's move on to the manufacturing process!
