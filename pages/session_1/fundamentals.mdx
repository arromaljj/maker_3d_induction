# Fundamentals of PCB Design

Before we dive into creating our Tiny Arcade Game PCB, let's cover some fundamental concepts of PCB design. These principles will guide us as we create our schematic and layout.

## Basic Electronic Components

Our Tiny Arcade Game uses several key components:

1. **ATtiny85 Microcontroller**: The brain of our game, processing inputs and controlling outputs.
2. **TP4056 Charging IC**: Manages the charging of our lithium battery from USB.
3. **USB Connector**: Provides power for charging and potentially data transfer.
4. **Lithium Battery**: Powers our game when not connected to USB.
5. **OLED Display**: Shows our game graphics.
6. **Push Buttons**: For user input.
7. **Piezo Buzzer**: Generates sound effects.
8. **Resistors and Capacitors**: Support proper circuit operation.
9. **LEDs**: Indicate charging status.

## Power Management Fundamentals

Understanding power management is crucial for our battery-powered device:

### Battery Charging

<Callout type="info">
  The TP4056 IC manages the charging process for our lithium battery, ensuring safe and efficient charging from USB power.
</Callout>

Key concepts:
- Constant Current (CC) and Constant Voltage (CV) charging phases
- Charge termination to prevent overcharging
- Temperature monitoring for safety

### USB Power Management

USB provides a 5V power source, which we use for charging. Considerations include:
- Current limitations (typically 500mA for USB 2.0)
- Voltage regulation for components that require 3.3V

## Design Considerations

When designing a PCB, consider these key factors:

1. **Functionality**: The PCB must fulfill its intended purpose effectively.
2. **Size and Form Factor**: Consider the physical constraints of your project.
3. **Component Placement**: Optimize for signal integrity and ease of assembly.
4. **Layer Stack**: Determine how many layers your PCB needs (we'll use two layers for our project).
5. **Power Distribution**: Ensure proper power delivery to all components.
6. **Signal Integrity**: Maintain clean signals, especially for high-speed designs.
7. **Thermal Management**: Consider heat dissipation for power-hungry components.
8. **Manufacturing Constraints**: Design with manufacturability in mind.

## Layout Best Practices

Follow these best practices to create efficient and reliable PCB layouts:

<Tabs items={['Component Placement', 'Routing', 'Power Distribution', 'Design for Manufacturing (DFM)']}>
  <Tab>
    - Group related components together
    - Place components on one side of the board when possible
    - Consider the physical size and height of components
    - Leave space for test points and mounting holes
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    - Use appropriate trace widths for current capacity
    - Maintain minimum clearances between traces
    - Avoid 90-degree angles in traces (use 45-degree or curved traces)
    - Keep sensitive signal traces short and direct
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    - Use a solid ground plane when possible
    - Consider using power planes for low-impedance power distribution
    - Place decoupling capacitors close to IC power pins
    - Use star grounding for analog circuits if necessary
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    - Follow your PCB manufacturer's design rules
    - Use standard board thicknesses and copper weights when possible
    - Consider panelization for efficient production
    - Add fiducial marks for automated assembly
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common PCB Design Mistakes to Avoid

Be aware of these common pitfalls:

1. **Insufficient Clearance**: Ensure adequate spacing between components and traces.
2. **Poor Grounding**: Improper grounding can lead to noise and unreliable operation.
3. **Ignoring Thermal Considerations**: Account for heat dissipation in your design.
4. **Overcomplicated Routing**: Keep trace routing as simple as possible for ease of manufacturing and debugging.
5. **Neglecting Design Rules**: Always follow manufacturer-specific design rules.
6. **Inadequate Documentation**: Properly label components and include necessary design information.

<Callout type="warning">
  Always double-check your design against design rules and best practices before sending it for fabrication. Mistakes caught early save time and money!
</Callout>

## Next Steps

With these fundamentals in mind, we're ready to start applying these principles to our Tiny Arcade Game PCB design. In the next section, we'll look at the specific requirements of our project and begin creating our schematic in KiCad.
